# The Wheel of Chumps

A simple, fun way to randomly assign someone from a provided list to perform a task. Because let's face it - nobody wants to volunteer.

## What is it?

The Wheel of Chumps is a cyberpunk-styled web app that takes the awkwardness out of task assignment. Enter a list of names, specify a task, and let the wheel decide who's doing the dishes, making the coffee run, or taking out the trash.

## How to Use

1. Enter names separated by commas (e.g., "Alice, Bob, Charlie, David")
2. Enter a task (e.g., "Wash the dishes", "Get coffee", "Deploy to production")
3. Click "SPIN THE WHEEL" and watch the drama unfold
4. The wheel has spoken. No appeals.
